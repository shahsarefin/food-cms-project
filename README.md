# Food CMS - SHAH

## Introduction

Food CMS by Shah Sultanul Arefin is a custom-built Content Management System for Food Manitoba designed to streamline online food menu management. Developed for my backend web development course, this CMS offers a user-friendly web interface for both customers and staff, enhancing the overall food ordering experience.

## Features

### 1- Content Management System CRUD

- **Create New Pages**: Admins can create new pages for the CMS, with at least 10 real-data pages including posts or products.
- **Edit and Delete Pages**: Admins have the authority to edit or delete existing pages through secured forms.
- **View and Sort Page List**: Admins can view a sortable list of existing pages, sorted at the database level for efficiency.
- **Category Management**: Admins can create, update, and assign categories to pages using a separate categories table.

### 2- User Navigation

- **Page Navigation**: Users can navigate through the pages created by admins, with a menu linking to all content.
- **Category-Based Navigation**: Users can browse pages by their associated categories through a dedicated menu system.

### 3- Content Search

- **Keyword Search**: Users can search for pages using keywords, with results linked directly to the CMS pages.

### 4- Validation and Security

- **Data Validation**: Validation rules are in place to ensure the integrity of the data when creating and updating pages.
- **Sanitization**: Numerical IDs and strings from GET or POST parameters are sanitized to prevent SQL injection and HTML injection attacks.

### 5- Image Uploads and Processing

- **Image Handling**: Admins can upload images to pages, with tests for 'image-ness' and proper handling of uploads.

### 6- Administrative Logins

- **Admin-Only Tasks**: Only admins can perform create, update, and delete (CUD) tasks, with additional measures for user management.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed and salted using PHP functions for secure storage and verification.

### 7- Advanced Web Technologies

- **AJAX**: AJAX is used to load foods based on category, enhancing user interaction without page reloads.

### 8- Deployment and Version Control

- **Git**: The projectâ€™s source code is managed with Git, ensuring version control and tracking of commits.
